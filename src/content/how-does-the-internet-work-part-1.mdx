<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify">
  Who doesn't use the internet at least once during the day? Almost everyone,
  right? You start by opening up your browser (Firefox, chrome, safari...etc.),
  write down your favourite website's **URL** (dev.to, Google.com...etc.) in the
  browser's address bar, you hit go and BOOM the website shows up, but have you
  ever considered how does this happen? what happens behind the scenes so once
  you gave the browser the website's address, it shows up?

<p align="justify">
  Understanding how the Internet works is very important. Lots of people usually
  skims through the surface of the concepts behind the working mechanism of the
  internet without fully understanding how everything works together. Without
  these foundations, it becomes very difficult to think about performance,
  optimizing sites and so on. Therefore, I decided to share with you what I know
  about that, and I decided to post it as a series so that the post won't take
  you too much time reading it.

<h2>Browsing the Internet</h2>

<section id="decoding-urls">
<h3>Decoding URLs</h3>

<p align="justify">
  When you enter a website's URL (Google.com ...E.g.) in your browser's address
  bar and hit the go button, the browser first needs to know the **IP address**
  of this domain you want to visit in order to navigate to it. Therefore, the
  browser checks its cache which keeps **DNS** records for (2-30 minutes). If it
  is not there, the browser sends a request to your internet router asking it
  _"Who is this Google.com fellow?"_ Your router does the same by checking its
  own cache for DNS records. If it is not there either, it sends the same
  request to your **ISP** asking the same question _"Do you know this
  google.com?"_ Your ISP sends the same request one more time to its DNS cache.
  The DNS replies back to the ISP: _"I don't know who google.com is but I have
  its address, here it is 127.217.7.23"_. The ISP returns the IP Address back to
  the router which in turn sends it back to your browser.

<h3>Navigating to the Website</h3>

<p align="justify">
  Once the browser receives the IP Address, it sends a HTTP request to that
  address asking for establishing a connection between the browser and the
  website's web servers. The Web servers handle the request, and reply back to
  the browser by sending the website's __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JavaScript__
  which the browser renders so that you can view the website's page as it should
  be.
