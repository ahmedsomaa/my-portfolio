  This part's title might be a little bit deceiving; as you might think of it as
  hacking the website, and shutting it down. Sorry to disappoint you, but this
  is not what the title amplifies. The [first
  part](http://som3aware.vercel.app/posts/how-does-the-internet-work-part-1) of
  this series finished at the website's web server replies back to your browser
  with the necessary HTML, CSS & JS files so that the browser can render the
  website. What the title indicates is to break down the website to its
  components (HMTL, CSS & JS), and have some fun playing with them. In order to
  do so, we need to open a browser (firefox...E.g.), navigate to google.com or
  any other website and turn on the developer's tools.

  First things first. I'll start by giving a simple explanation to each
  component.
</JustifiedText>

<h3>HTML</h3>

- stands for hyper text markup language.
- responsible for the structure of a web page.
- consists of elements represented in it by tags.

<h3>CSS</h3>

- stands for cascading style sheet.
- from the name, it describes the style of a HTML page and
  how HTML elements should be displayed.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>- the programming language of HTML and the web. - used in writing
the elements' handlers to interact with the backend.

Let's get to the fun part.

In order to turn on the developer's tools, you need to click on the
settings menu icon which usually looks like three vertical lines or dots,
then choose Web Developer (Firefox), and check the toggle tools tab, you
should be getting a result like this.

  From the image, you can see that Google's home page HTML is located on the
  left of the image and right next to it is the CSS. Now we're going to play
  with the HTML code, and try to do the following:
</JustifiedText>

- Change Google Search Button To Your Name Search.
- Delete I am Feeling Lucky Button.
- Delete the whole html code.

<JustifiedText>
__Let's start with the first one:__

In order to do so, we need to activate **pick an element from the page** button, located next to the
inspector tab to the left, by either clicking on it or by clicking **Ctrl+Shift+C**
from the keyboard. Then, we pick the element we want to edit so we're going to pick **Google Search**
for this one. The tools immediately highlights the html code for this button to you. What we're
going to do is to change the **value attribute** to Your Name instead of Google, press ENTER, and
voila you have your own search button ðŸ˜ƒ.

<JustifiedText>
__The second one:__

we'll follow the same steps as in one, but instead of changing the attribute value, we're going
to delete the following line:

</JustifiedText>

<CodeBlock title="main.html">
  ```html showLineNumbers
  <input
    class="RNmpXc"
    value="I'm Feeling Lucky"
    aria-label="I'm Feeling Lucky"
    name="btnI"
    type="submit"
    jsaction="sf.lck"
    data-ved="0ahUKEwi1opyl4bzkAhUI0uAKHd4BBqAQ19QECAo"
  />
  ```
</CodeBlock>

<Image

  width={600}
  height={400}
  alt="developer tools attribute value"
  src="/posts/how-does-the-internet-work-part2-img3.webp"
/>

<JustifiedText>
As the image shows, we successfully deleted the button. Can we do the same to the whole page, though?

**The third one:**

we'll do the same steps in two, but this time, we're going to delete the whole **body tag** code and see what happens.

</JustifiedText>

  As we can see from the image, the page is totally white; no google logo image,
  no buttons, no tabs, nothing at all. This is mainly because the code inside
  the __body tag__ is the structure of the page. So, does this means you deleted
  google forever, and you might go to jail for this?! ðŸ˜Ÿ. Absolutely not! What
  you just did is only deleting the copy of HTML code your browser got from
  Google's web servers for the request you sent earlier. If you enter google.com
  again in the browser's address bar and hit go, the process we talked about in
  [part1](http://som3aware.vercel.app/posts/how-does-the-internet-work-part-1)
  happens again, and you get another copy of the HTML code from Google's web
  servers so that your browser renders it and the full page shows up again like
  nothing happened.

  Here's what I did after I played a bit, I changed it to totally Somaa's Search
  Engine ðŸ˜‚.
