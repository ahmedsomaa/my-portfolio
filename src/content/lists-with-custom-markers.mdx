<h2 id="custom-markers">Kicking Off with Custom Markers</h2>

<JustifiedText>
First, let's swap out those standard markers with something more expressive. Here's how you can use the `::before` pseudo-element to introduce emojis into your unordered and ordered lists:
</JustifiedText>

<CodeBlock title="styles.css">
```css showLineNumbers
ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

li::before {
    content: "🚀 "
}
```
</CodeBlock>

<Image
    priority
    width={600}
    height={400}
    unoptimized
    src="/posts/custom-markers.webp"
    alt="an uordered lists with a rocket emoji marker"
/>

<JustifiedText>
In this example, every list item in `ul` starts with a rocket, blasting off each point with style!

<h2 id="conditional-markers">Conditional Marker Assignments</h2>

<JustifiedText>
Using the `nth-child` CSS selector, we could apply different emojis based on certain conditions. Let's add an emoji that 
represents the mood on every day of the week.

<CodeBlock title="styles.css">
```css showLineNumbers
ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

li:nth-child(7n + 1)::before {
    content: "😊"; /* Monday - Happy */
}

li:nth-child(7n + 2)::before {
    content: "😔"; /* Tuesday - Sad */
}

li:nth-child(7n + 3)::before {
    content: "😄"; /* Wednesday - Joyful */
}

li:nth-child(7n + 4)::before {
    content: "😡"; /* Thursday - Angry */
}

li:nth-child(7n + 5)::before {
    content: "😅"; /* Friday - Relieved */
}

li:nth-child(7n + 6)::before {
    content: "😴"; /* Saturday - Sleepy */
}

li:nth-child(7n + 7)::before {
    content: "🎉"; /* Sunday - Celebratory */
}
```
</CodeBlock>

<Image

    src="/posts/conditional-markers.webp"
    alt="an uordered list with an emoji for each day of the week"
/>

Here, each item in `ul` features a different facial expression, making the list more vibrant and playful.
