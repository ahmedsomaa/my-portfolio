<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<JustifiedText>
  In the [first part](https://som3aware.vercel.app/posts/streamlining-the-hiring-procese-part-1), we discussed how to empower
  LLMs and LangChain to streamline the hiring process, and you all might be wondering, _what's
  langchain?_ _What's LLM?_

  I could tell you to google them, but you might find them a bit complex to understand. So, like
  Thanos said, I'll do it myself and simply explain them to you here.

<h2 id="langchain---the-wizardry-behind-our-talent-show-tech">LangChain - The Wizardry Behind Our Talent Show Tech</h2>

<JustifiedText>
Imagine LangChain as the ultimate magician's wand or the infinity gauntlet in the world of tech. It was conjured by the tech wizard Harrison Chase in October 2022, and it's here to make building special tech tricks easier than ever!

Think of LangChain as your backstage crew, ready to lift the heaviest stuff for you. It's like having a team of strong stagehands who take care of all the tough work behind the scenes. ðŸŽ©âœ¨

Here's the scoop on how LangChain works its magic for our Talent Show Talent Scouter Bot:

</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="document-loaders">Document Loaders</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  Just like our backstage team gathers props from everywhere, LangChain's Document Loaders gather
  data from different places like PDFs, Word files, spreadsheets, and more. It's like having helpers
  who bring all the necessary materials for the show.
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="document-transformers">Document Transformers</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  Sometimes, the data is as long as a never-ending story. LangChain's Document Transformers come to
  the rescue by breaking down the data into smaller, manageable parts. Imagine turning a long script
  into bite-sized scenes!
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="prompts">Prompts</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  Think of Prompts as creating special scripts for our talented performers (LLMs). We tell them
  exactly what we want, and they dazzle us with their responses. It's like giving them cues for an
  amazing act!
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  Embeddings are like secret codes that LangChain uses to understand the hidden meaning behind
  words. It's like translating our messages into a magical language that LangChain and the LLMs can
  both understand.
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="vectorstores-and-retrievers">Vectorstores and Retrievers</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  Picture this - Vectorstores are like our organized shelves where LangChain keeps the magical
  translations. And Retrievers? They're the librarians who fetch the exact book we need from those
  shelves. It's like asking for a specific chapter from a huge library, and they find it in a snap!
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="chains">Chains</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  Imagine Chains as the magical strings that tie everything together in our tech-infused talent
  show. Just like a puppet master orchestrates their puppets, Chains make sure our questions and
  answers dance harmoniously.
</JustifiedText>

<JustifiedText>
Here's the secret sauce: Chains take your curious questions, wrap them in a cloak of understanding (kind of like a translator for wizards), and then they whisper to the super-smart LLM model. It's like asking a question and having the perfect answer appear right before your eyes!

Think of Chains as your backstage navigators, guiding the show's flow and making sure everything runs like a well-choreographed performance. With Chains at the helm, our Talent Scouter Bot waltzes through the world of data, finding the most enchanting insights and presenting them to you in the most delightful way! ðŸŽ­ðŸŒŸðŸ”—

So, you see, LangChain is like the ultimate tech magician's toolkit. It takes all the hard tricks and turns them into a grand performance without us having to break a sweat. With LangChain by our side, building our Talent Scouter Bot is as magical as watching a show come to life on stage! ðŸŽ­ðŸª„ðŸŒŸ

<JustifiedText>
  Hey there, fellow show enthusiasts! Before we dive into the dazzling world of LLMs, let's break
  down the basics in a way that even a backstage crew member would understand. ðŸŽ­âœ¨
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="meet-llms---the-language-wizards">Meet LLMs - The Language Wizards</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  LLMs, or Large Language Models, are like the maestros of language. Think of them as the ultimate
  wordsmiths, trained on tons of text to understand and predict what comes next. It's like having a
  crystal ball that can tell you the next word in a sentence, almost like magic!
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="llms-dance-of-understanding">LLMs' Dance of Understanding</h3>

<JustifiedText>
  These language geniuses use fancy algorithms (think of them as dance steps) to learn patterns and
  connections between words and sentences. Imagine learning a new dance routine by watching lots of
  performances - that's how LLMs learn from text!
</JustifiedText>

<h3 id="whats-in-their-talent-bag">What's in Their Talent Bag?</h3>

<h3 id="but-wait-theres-a-twist"> But Wait, There's a Twist!</h3>

<JustifiedText>
Just like any talent show, even LLMs have their quirks. Here are a few:

**1\. Hungry for Data:** They need loads of data to shine, which can be a bit of a data feast.

**2.** **Biased Flair:** Sometimes, their answers might be influenced by the data they learned from, leading to interesting biases.

**3.** **Creative (Maybe Too Much):** LLMs can sometimes make up believable but totally made-up stories.

**4.** **Tricky Situations:** They might struggle with rare or tricky questions, like an unexpected dance move.

So, there you have it, the lowdown on LLMs in our magical talent show! They're like the coolest acts with amazing tricks, though they have their own unique quirks. Just like a talented performer, they're here to make our tech world shine bright. ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰ðŸ”®
