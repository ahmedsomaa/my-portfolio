<h3 id="growth-and-expansion-2013-2018">Growth and Expansion (2013-2018)</h3>

<JustifiedText>
The early part of the decade saw substantial growth in the tech job market. The rise of cloud computing, mobile technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning drove a high demand for skilled professionals. Traditional tech hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and New York City thrived, while emerging hubs such as Austin, Miami, and Salt Lake City began to gain prominence.
